The target for polishing experiment planner is mobile platform positions on the 2D map:
the steps are shown as follows:
1. scan the environment and output the 3d data
2. obtain the 2D map for the navigation of mobile platform 
3. obtain the 3D stl document for the planning of mobile platform positions 
4. using 2D map for mobile platform navigation, i.e. put 2D map document into the mobile platform navigation package
5. MATLAB planning based on stl document
5.1 put stl document into bim_document folder
5.2 run main1.m, main2.m, main3.m
5.3 

polishing_mobile_platform_planner
1. matlab: output manipulator base positions
2. scanned_data: output stl document
3. planner: output mobile platform base positions
4. visualizer: visualize the mobile platform base positions
